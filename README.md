# Olympic_Data_Analysis_using_Python

The olympic data analysis table contains details of various sports persons, the year they participate in the olympic games,
the number of gold,silver and bronze medals they obtained and for the sports type on which they participate.

The use case expected is 

1. Create a dataframe by reading the Olympics table from Mysql in python and find the total number of medals won by every country.
2. Display the top 10 medal winners 
3. List down the countries that own more number of medals in the year 2000
4. Find out the top three countries which won the maximum combination of gold,silver and bronze medals.
5. Find out the age group which grabs more number of medals in olympics
6. Plot a bar graph for depicting number of medals USA won year wise for the sport swimming.
